# 🔥(POC) Demo of An Unpopular Opinion: AI + SOC Analysts  

> **AI will replace bad SOC Analysts, not good ones.**  

I just built an **Agentic AI SOC Analyst / Threat Hunter** that does hours of manual work in minutes.  

It can:  
- 🔍 Hunt threats  
- ⚡ Prioritize intelligently  
- 📝 Investigate + document findings  

All **faster than any junior analyst I’ve ever seen**.  

---

## ❓ Does this mean SOC Analysts are obsolete?  
❌ **No.**  
But it does mean the days of “click-next analysts” are numbered.  

👉 The future SOC team will be **human + AI**:  
- 🤖 **AI handles**: noise, repetition, speed  
- 🧠 **Humans handle**: intuition, creativity, strategy  

---

## 💥 The Controversial Part  
- Companies won’t need as many entry-level analysts — **AI will fill that gap**.  
- The analysts who thrive will be those who **leverage AI as a partner, not compete with it**.  

---

## 🎥 Demo  
I even made a short demo video of my Agentic AI in action —  
doing the work *with me*, not *for me*.  

---

## 💭 What do you think?  
- Is AI going to be the **end of SOC analyst jobs**?  
- Or is it the **biggest upgrade our industry has ever seen**?
